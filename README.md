# RVGL Butler for Android
This repository contains the code for the RVGL Assistant app for Android.

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3b0edd314a6a4149becd6461103984f2)](https://www.codacy.com/app/Tavisco/RVGL-Assistant_Android?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Tavisco/RVGL-Assistant_Android&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

### This project is no longer maintained at the moment. The major issue with it right now is that it's written in Java (and not Kotlin), use a lot of outdated componentes, and I was a far more amateur programmer when wrote this code. A whole overhaul/rewrite from the ground up would be necessary and sadly I don't have the time for it. Feel free to fork it if desired, or build something similar! :D

### What this app does?

| Install cars and levels from *.zip and *.7z files right after downloading it | Check for updates (Game and installed I/O packs) | Install I/O packs on the fly | View levels and cars (and their attributes! - WIP)|
